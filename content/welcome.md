# welcome

How do you do fellow human. In this workshop we're going to learn about what
it's like to build javascript like kids these days do. And no, we don't mean
_those_ kids. We mean those other kids. Uhu.

We're <sup>1</sup> going to show you what can be done these days with JS — assembling
frontend, and backend — then smoothing it over with a nice layer of
performance. Because performance baby, that's what we're about.

So turn over the next page (like the kids say), and get ready for some

__ＪＡＶＡＳＣＲＩＰＴ__.

## Requirements
This workshop assumes you're running a recent-ish version of Node (>=4.0) and
are comfortable with writing JS. Should you have any questions: there'll be
mentor(s) to help out, so don't hesitate to ask. Good luck!
