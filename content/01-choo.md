# choo

In this workshop we're going to be exploring both frontend, and backend
performance. To explore what we can do in the frontend, we're going to make use
of the [choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo) framework.

Choo is a sturdy framework that's built for maintainability and iteration
speed. Let's get started by setting up a Choo project.

```sh
$ npx create-choo-app <project-name>
```

- Show which steps to take next.
